NOTE : 
- Don't generate VAO/VBO/EBO before the window is created otherwise it will crash will throw access violation
- GLM::vec is very bad at storing

TODO :
- Allow to see shaders and models in a panel as a list
- test to move objects, rotate them and scale them with button
- editor manager with selected object
- File linker (to change textures and Folder quickly for customisation and easy writing)
